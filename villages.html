            <h1>THE VILLAGES + MIDTOWN</h1> 
            <p>I grew up in Greenwich village and predominately hung out in the villages and Midtown.
                Despite being called the "grossest" part of Manhattan, I think this is the best area for culture 
                and there is always something new to try and something new happening.

            <h2>St.Tropez</h2>
            <p>Saint Tropez has been listed by multiple publications as the best French restaurant 
                in the city, and I agree. Everything here just tastes so fresh and clean, it's amazing how they 
                can turn simple ingredients into such amazing flavors. I love to get seafood here, try something new! 
                They won't disappoint.</p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                I love sea food and how diffeerent cultures cook it - St.Tropez is probably the best place in the city for 
                authentic French seafood. Some of my favorite things on their (very French) menu - Pieuvre Grillée (grilled octopus 
                $16), Daube Provencale (traditional beef stew $22), the Truffle Mac & Cheese ($22), and the Risotto d’Orge aux Champignon 
                (risotto with three types of mushrooms, $22).

            <h2>Raku</h2>
            <p>I first came to Raku with two of my friends on a food crawl in the East Village, funnily enough I didn't get ramen or udon but had rice. 
                This place has been listed as the number 1 udon place in the city over and over again, and it truly is that good. The 
                seating is limited and they are almost always busy, but the wait is definitely worth it! *They are cash only! </p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                Some of my favorite things on their menu include the chicken tatsua-age (japanese marinated fried chicken, $11/18), unatama don (eel + egg rice bowl), 
                the kamonan udon (with duck, $21), and the gyunan udon (with washugyu beef, $20). They also have a variety of cold noodles to try for those hot summer days. 
                Definitely take a chance here, you won't be disappointed!

            <h2>Thursday Kitchen</h2>
            <p>Another place I encountered on a food crawl with friends. This place is an amazing restaurant that serves Korean styled tapas,
                the chef really puts a unique twist on the traditional Spansih dishes with Korean flavors. They are also known for having a super
                friendly staff and some potent drinks. The headchef and the owner of the restaurant is Kay Hyun, a South Korean chef that's previously worked some of the best kitchens in the 
                city - ex. Jean-Georges, Nobu's Mai House, and Buddakan. </p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                Some of my favorite things on their menu are their Kimichi Paella ($15), Truffle Mac & Cheese (14), 
                Duck Confit Empanadas ($14), and Salmon Tartare Taco ($15). This is one of those places that switch their menus around depending on 
                what fresh ingredients are avaliable throughout the season, so definitely don't be afraid to try some new things.

            <h2>Kazunori</h2>
            <p>Kazunori is the second restauraunt concept by the same team behind Sugarfish - yep, that's right. You know they're good. 
                The restaurant sources their quality fish via the West Coast. This place is where you want to go to try authentic Japanese sushi 
                (clean and delicate) without breaking your bank.  </p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                I always reconmmend asking the chefs for what to order at these places, especially because so many times they will make you special
                rolls that are their personal favorites. As for their offical menu though, I love getting their handroll sets, which they offer with 
                3-4 pieces ($17-$33). I love getting salmon, yellowtail, toro, and white tuna!

            <h2>Yoon Haeundae Galbi</h2>
            <p>My sister first found this Korean BBQ place when they first opened. It's located slightly off of K-town (33rd St), but it is just
                as authentic if not better than the others. Since our first time coming here, this place has become a classic in our family - from birthday
                celebrations to family visits, this is where we go. </p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                I typically get about the same things at Korean BBQ - marinated short ribs (galbi), pork belly, and ribeye. Typically at Yoon, we get a set of
                their platter with a variety of meats ($126-$136), along with rice, the crispy potato pancake ($15), or their seafood tofu stew ($18, my mom's favorite!)
                They also have somme amazing cocktails with unique Asian flavors! A family favorite is their Yuzu Spritzel ($12), made with yuzu honey, prosecco, and lime!
                Also, their Asian Pear Sorbet ($7)  is absolutely amazing and a must try!

            <h2>Artichoke Basille</h2>
            <p>If you have ever met me, I have probably told you all about this pizza. Artichoke Basille is a New York favorite, with locations all over
                the city. I still remember my mom buying me a slice in the 3rd grade, immediately I fell in love. Don't be put off by the idea of eating 
                artichokes on your pizza! This place has done so well for a reason :) their pizza tastes like a little slice of heaven</p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                I would have more to say, exept the highlight of Artichoke Basille is no other than their Artichoke Pizza ($7). I know, $7 for a pizza?? 
                I promise you it's worth it (also the slice is huge!). They also sell other pizzas of course, including a Crab Pizza ($7) with crab sauce
                and Surimi stuffing. Also, did I mention it's open till 5AM?

            <h2>Jack's Wife Freda</h2>
            <p>This is another New York classic chain (like Ruby's!). They have locations all around the city, serving up some classic dishes with Mediterranean
                influences. I love coming here with friends for a chillaxing meal! We always leave super full but never feel bad because everything is so fresh and 
                healthy. This is the place to come if you are trying to eat healthier but still want those big flavors! </p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                Similar to Ruby's, I've been here so many times throughout the year that I'm proud to say I have tried *almost* everything on the menu!
                Their Green Shakashuka ($15) and Madame Freda (a twist on the Croque Madame, $22) are my favorites for breakfast. I also love their Bennie’s Chicken Schnitzel
                ($25), Zuccini Chips ($14), and Peri Peri Chicken ($28)!

            <h2>Kenka</h2>
            <p> St.Mark's Place may just be my favorite area in the city in summer. There is always something happening here - and Kenka is the hot spot. 
                If you want cheap but good Japanese food, this is the place to be. Kenka is a very small but popular eatery/pub similar to what you'd see in Japan, serving ramen, 
                ominokiyaki, croquettes, etc. all for under $10! Because of these cheap prices though, there is almost always a line to get in, so get there early!
            </p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                My mom and I would often come here after my dance classes, we'd always get their Croquettes ($4.50), Ika Yaki BBQ Squid ($5.50), and my favorite 
                Omurice ($6.50). These dishes are small and are meant to be shared over a drink so it's the perfect chance to try something new! Kenka has been a neighborhood
                staple for years and it definitely won't be changing anytime soon.
