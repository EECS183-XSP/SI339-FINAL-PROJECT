            <h1>Chinatown</h1> 
            <p>I remember my mom taking me to Chinatown almost every single weekend when I was younger.
                This is where we found the ingredients for traditional dishes and got take out for those
                that are too difficult to cook. There are so many amazing restaurants here serving traditonal 
                Chinese food from all over China, this is where I go when I'm homesick.

            <h2>Breakroom</h2>
            <p> BreakRoom is my absolute favorite spot in the city to grab some tacos. They are not 
                your traditional tacos though, these are Asian and American cuisine inspired tacos! 
                They also specialize in loaded tater tots, hotdogs, and burgers! 
            </p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                My favorite things on the menu has to the be the Baja Fish taco ($4), which you can also 
                get as a burger! I usually go for the taco platter ($14) and switch up what I get. Top picks?
                Crispy Pork Belly, Tempura Avocado, Carnitas, and Crispy Shrimp. The loaded nachos and hotdogs 
                are also great. Top it all off withe their mint lemonade ($3)!

            <h2>456 Shanghai Restaurant</h2>
            <p> My mom used to always take me to 456 to get lunch in between our weekened errands. This place is filled 
                with lots of good memories and in my opinion, one of the best places in Chinatown. </p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                We used to always get the Pan Fried Pork Baos ($6.75) to start off our meals. Some of my other favorites include the 
                Sweet & Sour Fish Fillets ($18.75), Spicy Eggplant and Pork ($12.95), and Soup Dumplings ($6.75). Fun fact, this place was 
                called "Dumpling Heaven" by the New York Times! This is definitely a great place to go for a casual meal and is one of my 
                family's favorite.
