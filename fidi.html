            <h1>FINANCIAL DISTRICT</h1> 
            <p>This area was one of the first places I visited when we first moved to New York.
                My aunt worked on Beaver street sand we had some friends that lived nearby. Now that 
                I am a business student, it seems like I will always have ties to FiDi.</p>

            <h2>Tacombi</h2>
            <p>The first restaurant I wanted to showcase here, is Tacombi! The food here is always amazing and 
                they have a huge selection of vegeterian options. I love coming here in the summer, especially because 
                of their outdoor seating area!</p>
            <p class="highlights"> 
                My favorite thing to get on the menu include the Baja Crispy Fish Taco ($6.49), Carnitas Taco ($4.49), and their Gringa Quesadilla ($8.95). If you are over the age of 
                21, the restaurant also has some good cocktail options, inclduing their $55 margrita pitchers.
